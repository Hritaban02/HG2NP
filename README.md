# Heterogeneous Graph Generation: A Hierarchical Approach using Node Feature Pooling

## Implementation of the paper accepted in IJCNN 2025

Model - Refers to HG2NP (Our) Implementation

--------------------------------------

DiGress - Used to create skeleton homogeneous graphs.

HGEN - Another heterogeneous graph generation that was tried out but couldn't be fully adapted.

MAGNN - Repository using which the IMDB and DBLP datasets were preprocessed.

NetGAN, VGAE - Other graph generation methods that were used for comparisons.
